Description: The tool works by means of implementing a form of the Bradley-Terry model.
    This model, trained on real-world tennis data, produces a GLM designed to predict whether a given player will win a match.  The parameters for this model then inform the comparison.  The result is a probability representing the likelihood of winning.
